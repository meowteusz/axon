# AXON

## What?
Conversations are rarely linear. It is in our nature and best interests to go on tagents. Naturally, a linear chat interface will steer conversation in one direction; going on a tangent feels clunky. Axon aims to provide an interface that more closely mirrors organic conversation flow.
